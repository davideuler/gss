# Latest Release #

You can try GSS  without having to set up a development environment and build from source, by deploying the latest EAR file. This file would probably not be suitable for production use as is, since it contains [GRNet](http://www.grnet.gr)-specific branding and configuration settings. Note that it also requires a properly set up production environment, as described in BuildingAndDeploying.

This latest release may not contain all recent changes, but has received integration testing and is recommended for production use.
